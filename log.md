**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all challenges on Responsive Design with Bootstrap at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** 2nd day of #100DaysOfCode, currently the begginer stuff seems pretty straight forward and logical. Will continue with jQuery and JavaScript.

### Day 3: March 28, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all challenges on jQuery at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** 3rd day of #100DaysOfCode, jQuery was a new knowledge I got. Interesting how you can apply different JavaScript features to HTML elements in your project - enrich, manipulate and handle HTML. Seems that will have to revise this soon - during some project or just go back to these challenges a do them once more.

### Day 4: March 29, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all challenges on jQuery at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** 4th day of #100DaysOfCode, Did the basic "Tribute page" project at #freeCodeCamp Technically finished but would like some update. Take-away is that some scetch prior coding would make it easier - will do so for next project

**Thoughts**: 6th day of #100DaysOfCode - as didn't have much time to use laptop figured out to use #SoloLearn mobile app. Did the whole JavaScript Tutorial course, so it will be useful when back to #freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges.

**Thoughts**: 7th day of #100DaysOfCode - played around with #SoloLearn mobile app. Did the HTML and SQL tutorial course + continued with #freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript challenges. Getting complicated with all that JavaScript stuff :D
