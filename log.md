### Day 2: March 27, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all challenges on Responsive Design with Bootstrap at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** 2nd day of #100DaysOfCode, currently the begginer stuff seems pretty straight forward and logical. Will continue with jQuery and JavaScript.

### Day 3: March 28, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all challenges on jQuery at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** 3rd day of #100DaysOfCode, jQuery was a new knowledge I got. Interesting how you can apply different JavaScript features to HTML elements in your project - enrich, manipulate and handle HTML. Seems that will have to revise this soon - during some project or just go back to these challenges a do them once more.
